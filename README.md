The quad_codes folder consists of all the codes implemented on the stm32f303vc micro-controller discovery board.
The kill_sw code is the latest one which is functional and is recommended to use. The code implements the Linear Kalman Filter (LKF) and the PID control law for the attitude and the altitude stabilization of the quadcopter. 
NOTE that the configuration of the drone is in the plus shape.
